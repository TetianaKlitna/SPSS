Hypothesis A/B testing in Healthcare: Drug Safety in the statistical software SPSS:
1. A chi-square test was used to compare the presence of adverse effects between the drug and placebo groups, and the result (p = 0.964) showed no significant difference in the rates of side effects between the two groups.
2. A chi-square test of association was used to investigate if the number of adverse effects is independent of the treatment and control groups.
   The result (p = 0.615) indicates that the number of adverse effects and the treatment/control groups are independent. The gamma and Spearman's correlation coefficients further confirm that the variables are nearly independent or have a very weak monotonic relationship.
4. The normality of the age distributions in the two groups was examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk, Q-Q plot, and P-P plot tests.
5. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the ages between the drug group and the placebo group, and the result (p = 0.257) showed no significant difference in ages between the two groups.
